# R Feature Generation

This project contains a collection of feature generation scripts and library functions
that have proven useful on multiple projects over the years.

I am gradually transforming the code to make it re-usable without modification, but
that generally means I need to make assumptions about the contents of certain columns.

These assumptions will be noted at the top of every individual library function.
